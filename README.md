# Outdated

I would reccomend grabbing the latest version from the Stormlight Tech fork as it patches a known security flaw in 0.2.6 and earlier.

Please note that development is on hold until the end of the weekend. I am away until Monday so unable to carry on. Updates will start to be pushed again within the week.

#### Disclaimer

I am not the original dev of this CAD. You can find that information above. I have just taken the files, worked on them and resolved some issues. I am NOT a PHP developer so my code may not be pretty but it's functional, I'll modify and pretty up the code when I can.
